# CPU Virtualization: Processes and Scheduling

* Processes are a purely virtual concept
* Separating policies and mechanisms enables modularity
* Schedulers need to optimize for different metrics: utilization, turnaround,
  response time, fairness and forward progress
    * FIFO: simple, non-preemptive scheduler
    * SJF: non-preemptive, prevents process jams
    * STFC: preemptive, prevents jams of late processes
    * RR: preemptive, great response time, bad turnaround
    * MLFQ: preemptive, most realistic
    * CFS: fair scheduler by virtualizing time
* Past behavior is good predictor for future behavior

---

# Memory Virtualization: Segmentation and Paging

* OS manages access to constrained resources
    * Principle: limited direct execution (bare metal when possible, intercept
      when needed)
    * ***CPU:*** time sharing between processes (low switching cost)
    * ***Memory:*** space sharing (disk I/O is slow, so time sharing is expensive)
* ***Fragmentation:*** space lost due to internal or external padding
* ***Paging:*** MMU fully translates between virtual and physical addresses
    * One flat page table (array)
    * Multi-level page table
    * Pros? Cons? What are size requirements?
* Paging and swapping allows process to execute with only the working set
  resident in memory, remaining pages can be stored on disk

# Concurrency

\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw [orange, ultra thick] (0,0) rectangle (2,4);
\node[text width=3cm, rotate=90] at (1, 2.5) {Virtualization};
\draw [fill, blue, ultra thick] (3,0) rectangle (5,4);
\node[text width=3cm, rotate=90] at (4, 2.5) {Concurrency};
\draw [green, ultra thick] (6,0) rectangle (8,4);
\node[text width=3cm, rotate=90] at (7, 2.5) {Persistence};

\draw [red, ultra thick] (0,4.5) -- (8,4.5);
\draw [red, ultra thick] (0,4.5) -- (4,6);
\draw [red, ultra thick] (4,6) -- (8,4.5);
\node[text width=3cm] at (5, 5) {Security};

\end{tikzpicture}

---

# Concurrency topics

* Abstraction: locks to protect shared data structures
* Mechanism: interrupt-based locks
* Mechanism: atomic hardware locks
* Busy waiting (spin locks) versus wait queues
* Condition variables
* Semaphores
* Signaling through condition variables and semaphores

---

# Difference parallelism and concurrency

* ***Parallelism:*** multiple threads (or processes) working on a single task using
  multiple CPU cores (i.e., stuff happens at the same physical time)
* ***Concurrency:*** tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods
  (i.e., tasks run at the same virtual time)

---

# Concurrency summary

* Spin lock, CV, and semaphore synchronize multiple threads/processes
    * ***Spin lock:*** atomic access, no ordering, spinning
    * ***Condition variable:*** atomic access, queue, OS primitive
    * ***Semaphore:*** shared access to critical section with (int) state
* All three primitives are equally powerful
    * Each primitive can be used to implement both other primitives
    * Performance may differ!
* Synchronization is challenging and may introduce different types of
  bugs such as atomicity violation, order violation, or deadlocks.

# Persistence Topics

* Device interaction and device drivers
* IO Scheduling and harddrive throughput
    * Disk layout
    * Disk virtualization (RAID)
* Filesystem API
* Filesystem implementation
    * Inodes and devices
    * File descriptors
    * File names
* Crash resistance
* Journaling

---

# IO/Driver Summary

* Overlap IO and computation as much as possible!
    * Use interrupts
    * Use DMA
* Driver classes provide common interface
* Storage: read/write/seek of blocks
* Minimize random IO (i.e., quick sort is really bad on HDDs)
* Carefully schedule IO on slow devices
* RAID virtualizes disks

---

# Filesystem summary

* Filesystem API: handle interaction with the file system
* Three ways to identify a file
    * File names (for humans)
    * Inodes and devices (on the disk)
    * File descriptors (for a process)
* Filesystem implementation
    * Inodes for metadata
    * Bitmaps for inodes/data blocks
    * Superblock for global metadata
* Crash resistance: filesystem check (FSCK)
* Journaling: keep track of metadata, enforce atomicity
    * All modern filesystems use journaling
    * FSCK still useful due to bitflips/bugs

# Security

# Two topics: testing and mitigations

* Testing helps developers find as many bugs as possible
    * Fuzzing generates test cases
    * Sanitization detects policy violations
* Mitigations detect policy violations at runtime, stop exploits

---

# Testing summary

* Software testing finds bugs before an attacker can exploit them
* Manual testing: write test cases to trigger exceptions
* Fuzz testing automates and randomizes testing
* Sanitizers allow early bug detection, not just on exceptions
* AddressSanitizer is the most commonly used sanitizer and enforces
  probabilistic memory safety by recording metadata for every allocated object
  and checking every memory read/write.

---

# Mitigations Summary

* Deployed mitigations do not stop all attacks
* ***Data Execution Prevention*** stops code injection attacks, but does not
  stop code reuse attacks
* ***Address Space Layout Randomization*** is probabilistic, shuffles memory space,
  prone to information leaks
* ***Stack Canaries*** are probabilistic, do not protect against direct
  overwrites, prone to information leaks
* ***Control-Flow Integrity*** restricts control-flow hijack attacks, does not protect against
  data-only attacks

# Learning goals

![Understading OS' will help your career!](./figures/50-learn.jpg){width=400px}

---

# Learning goals: class

* Learn core concepts
* Become aware of design decisions and policies
    * Virtualization: CPU and Memory
    * Concurrency: performance trade-offs
    * Persistence: correctness and recovery
    * Security: software testing versus mitigations

---

# Learning goals: labs

* Lab 0: practice C programming and debugging
* Lab 1: thread scheduling and memory allocation
* Lab 2: concurrency and message passing
* Lab 3: simple file system
* Lab 4: software security testing

But the main goal was to become better programmers, i.e., using a specification
to implement and test a prototype, then integrate it into the overall system.

---

# Final Exam: Outline
