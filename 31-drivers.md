# Topics covered in this lecture

* How does the OS interact with devices
* Design of device drivers
* Types of IO devices
* Components of hard drives
* Calculating hard drive throughput
* Scheduling algorithms for IO

This slide deck covers chapters 36, 37 in OSTEP.

---

# Motivation

* So far we have talked about the CPU and about RAM
* How do we get data into RAM?
    * Load programs and data from storage
    * Read and write packets from the network (maybe even streams?)
    * Write data to a terminal or the screen
    * Read data from input devices such as keyboard/mouse/camera
* Devices provide input/output (IO) to a system

* IO allows information to *persist* (RAM is volatile)!
* Enables interesting computation!

# Ancient device history

![PDP-11/20 at Mus√©e Bolo](./figures/31-pdp11.jpg){ width=300px }

* Peripherals connected to UNIBUS
* Each peripheral sets memory area it "listens" to
* No memory protection

---

# Ancient device history

* Each device (not type!) had a unique hardware interface
* Applications contained code to communicate with devices
* Application polled device to set/get information

---

# Modern device interface

* The OS handles device management (and access)
* OS exposes a uniform interface to applications
* IO is interrupt driven

# Terminology

* Northbridge is also called memory controller hub
* Southbridge is also called I/O Controller Hub (ICH / Intel) or Fusion Controller Hub (FCH / AMD)
* The southbridge is connected to the CPU through the northbridge which has a direct connection

. . .

But how do devices work?

# Device protocol (1/3)

```.C
while (STATUS == BUSY) ; // 1. spin
// 2. Write data to DTA register
*dtaRegister = DATA;
// 3. Write command to CMD register
*cmdRegister = COMMAND;
while (STATUS == BUSY) ; // 4. spin
```

* Wait until device is ready
* Set data and command (why send data first?)
* Wait until command has completed

. . .

Where do you see problems?

* Busy waiting (1. and 4.) wastes cycles twice
* CPU should not need to wait for completion of command
* Solution: embrace asynchronous communication
    * Inform device of request (to get rid of 1.)
    * Wait for signal of completion (to get rid of 4.)

* Instead of spinning, the OS (driver) waits for an interrupt
    * Interrupts are handled centrally through a dispatcher
    * On interrupt arrival, wake up kernel thread that waits on that interrupt

---

# Interrupt performance

* Can interrupts lead to worse performance than polling?

. . .

* Yes: livelock (e.g., a flood of arriving network packets)
    * A livelock is *similar to a deadlock* (no process makes progress, resulting
      in starvation) with the difference that the states of the processes
      constantly change
    * For example: network packets arrive; interrupt handling
      and context switch is costly, prohibiting the application from reacting to
      the packets and them simply queuing up.

. . .

* Real systems therefore use a mix between polling and interrupts
    * Interrupts allow overlap between computation and IO, most useful for slow devices;
    * Use polling for short bursts or small amounts of data
* Another optimization is *coalescing*, i.e., the device waits for a bit until more
  requests complete, then batch sends everything.

* **PIO (Programmed IO)**: CPU tells the device *what* data
    * One instruction for each byte/word
    * Efficient for a few bytes, scales terribly

. . .

* **DMA (Direct Memory Access)**: tell device *where* data *is*
    * One instruction to send a pointer
    * Efficient for large data transfers

---

# How to transfer data?

* IO ports
    * Each device has an assigned IO port
    * Special instructions (`in`/`out` on x86) communicate with device
* Memory mapped IO
    * Device maps its registers to memory
    * Loads/stores interact with device

. . .

* Both are used in practice. Architectures now support both. Differences are a matter of choice and preference.

---

# Support for different devices

* Challenge: different devices have *different protocols*
* Drivers are specialized pieces of code for a particular device
    * Low end communicates with the device
    * High end exposes generic interface to OS

. . .

* Drivers are an example of *encapsulation*
    * Different drivers adhere to the same API
    * OS only implements support for APIs based on device class
* Requirement: well-designed interface/API
    * Trade-off between versatility and over-specialization
    * Due to device class complexity, OS ends with layers of APIs

# HDD: seek, rotate, transfer

* Seek is costly (several ms, "an eternity")
    * function of cylinder distance
    * operations: accelerate, coast, decelerate, settle
* Rotate: 7200 RPM, 8.3 ms/rotation
* Transfer: (100MB/s): 5 us for 512 B

. . .

* Seeks and rotation is slow, transfer is fast
    * Sequential access is much faster (blocks are ordered)
    * Random access is slow

---

# IO scheduling

* Given concurrent IO requests, how should they be scheduled?
    * Different constraints than CPU scheduling
    * ... but the same algorithms!

. . .


* Position of disk head relative to requested position matters more than length of the transfer

---

# Optimization: buffering

* A buffer cache between the disk and the higher level of the OS keeps most recently used disk blocks around
* Proactively fetches blocks that are likely accessed
* Keep track of dirty blocks that need to be written back

---

# First come first serve

* Assume 10ms average seek and rotation time
* Requests: 30001, 70001, 30002, 70002, 30003, 70003: 60ms
    * How can we improve?

. . .

* Requests: 30001, 30002, 30003, 70001, 70002, 70003: 20ms
    * Shortest seek time: seek to closest block (minding starvation)
    * Elevator/SCAN: go outwards/inwards, serve requests along
    * Clever optimizations of shortest seek time/elevator

---

# Completely fair queuing (Linux)

* Queue for each process
* Weighted round-robin between queues with slice-time proportional to priority
* Yield slice only if idle for given time

. . .

Scheduling algorithms for CPU time are also useful for I/O

# Going beyond one disk

* A single disk has many limitations
    * Single point of failure
    * Limited performance
    * Limited size
* File systems work on a single disk (or partition)
* How can we increase flexibility?

. . .

* One more layer of indirection: a virtual disk!

---

# RAID: Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks

* Idea: build logical disk from (many) physical disks

. . .

* RAID0: Striping (no mirroring or parity)
    * n performance, n capacity, 0/n can fail
* RAID1: Data mirroring (no parity or striping)
    * n performance, (n-1)/n can fail
* RAID2: bit level striping (historic, sync'd, one parity drive)
* RAID3: byte level striping (historic, sync'd, one parity drive)
* RAID4: block level striping (historic, one drive holds parity)
* RAID5: block level striping, distributed parity
    * n performance, n-1 capacity, 1/n can fail
* RAID6: block level striping, distributed parity
    * n performance, n-2 capacity, 2/n can fail

---

# RAID: combinations

* RAID 01: two stripes (RAID0) that are mirrored (RAID1)
* RAID 10: stripe (RAID0) a set of mirrored devices (RAID1)
* Which one is more reliable?

# Summary

* Overlap IO and computation as much as possible!
    * Use interrupts
    * Use DMA
* Driver classes provide common interface
* Storage: read/write/seek of blocks
* Minimize random IO (i.e., quick sort is really bad on HDDs)
* Carefully schedule IO on slow devices
* RAID virtualizes disks
